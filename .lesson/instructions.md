## Activity 8: Find the Secret Code
# Instructions  

Open the console by clicking the wrench icon in the top righthand corner of the replit browser. 

Then, open script.js and follow the instructions in comments above each section.

1. Set the secret code to a three-letter word
2. Print the code to the console using the variable `secretCode`
3. Guess a string
4. Write some conditionals (`if`/`else` statements) to help us check if we guessed correctly
5. Write your own conditional that let's a user know in the console if they guessed the right word. `console.log()` a string that tells them if they are right or wrong.
6. Check to see if a certain letter is in our secret code. We can do this with `.includes()`
7. Write an `if` statement (a conditional) that looks at the length of the secret code
8. Use the 'or' operator || to write a conditional that checks if the secretCode.length is *either* greater than OR less than 3

## Activity 9: Saying Hello with Conditionals

Open up step-9.js and follow the directions for writing conditionals that say hello to different people in your life.


## Activity 10: Saying Hello with conditionals
Open up step-10.js and write a for loop. Change the for loop based on each challenge

REFERENCE:
for (let index = 0; index < 11; index++) {
  console.log(index)
}
